# day 1

Create and finish app idea

# day 2

Proposal and desigh sketches

# day 3

Basic interface development

## Design choices

Start with ATM function for simple prototype

Target more users by changing project into Budget Boss instead of Backpacker's Budget Boss, so other people like students or people in debt are not excluded

Budget Boss name is already taken

Idea for first version: app will focus on bank transactions and visiualise how much of the budget is left while automatically converting currencies, using exchange rate api

# day 4

Advanced interface development

functionalities for prototype included

## Design choices

App idea changed. App will be a helper to give all relevant information for atm transactions in foreighn countries instead of a budget monitor. Bacause of this, the app will be a lot more simplistic and more relevant than the original idea.

Listener implemented to edittext. User can see changes as the user is typing, no need to press an extra button to see effect

for sake of prototype main screen will visualise current balance compared to starting balance, atm function visualises proposed withdrawal ammount compared to current balance, not tot start balance

Withdrawal history will be added

## Design problems

### double datatype inaccuracy
### collect data from users?
### forced updates from user?
### transaction costs?

# Day 5

Change README.md to match new target of project

Design document

Bug fixes

## Design Choices

New class will be made to contain all common methods. Methods will be static wherefore no new instances must be created every time.

View (left) button will get transaction history screen with listview

## Design porblems

### using accounts yes or no? This is a big crack in user comfort, but a huge leap in the value of data collection.
### how will android's retrun button behave?

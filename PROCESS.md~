# day 1

Create and finish app idea

# day 2

Proposal and desigh sketches

# day 3

Basic interface development

## Design choices

Start with ATM function for simple prototype

Target more users by changing project into Budget Boss instead of Backpacker's Budget Boss, so other people like students or people in debt are not excluded

Budget Boss name is already taken

Idea for first version: app will focus on bank transactions and visiualise how much of the budget is left while automatically converting currencies, using exchange rate api

# day 4

Advanced interface development

## Design choices

App idea changed. App will be a helper to give all relevant information for atm transactions in foreighn countries instead of a budget monitor. Bacause of this, the app will be a lot more simplistic and more relevant than the original idea.
